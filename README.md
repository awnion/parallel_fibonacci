# Parallel Fibonacci numbers

Multiple language implementation of Fibonacci numbers

## Why?

Whole idea is to write Fibonacci numbers in different languages like you would do in a real application: simple, practical, maybe a little bit boring/dumb. Also we will utilize all cores as much as we can.

Could be more than one implementation per language.
